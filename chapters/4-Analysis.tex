\section{Overview}

Our goal is to develop a system that classifies images of different small mechanical parts (SMPs), and to do so as accurately as possible. To realize this goal, we decide to leverage state-of-the-art advancements in Convolutional Neural Network algorithms in the field of computer vision, and more specifically, the sub-field of image classification.

We aim to build a system that scales up well, ie. we would like the classification system to easily adapt new small mechanical parts. Moreover we would like to build a system that can scale up to thousends of classes.

CNN algorithms are characteristically data-hungry. The classification accuracy of a CNN algorithm is proportional to the amount of images that are fed in as input. Given the large number of classes, the task of collecting images of each small mechanical part becomes time-consuming and labour-intensive. To combat this problem, we decide to augment the training data of our algorithms with \textit{synthetic images}: 2-dimentional renditions of 3-dimensional computerized graphical models of the small mechanical parts. We hypothesize that our synthetically augmented training set will yield a higher accuracy, whilst minimizing the manual effort needed to take real images of the small mechanical parts.

\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

Functional requirements (FRs) describe the interactions between the system and the its environment independent of its implementation. \cite{bruegge2004object}.

The system's main function is to classify images of different small mechanical parts. Furthermore, the system needs to be dynamic and scalable to accomodate new small mechanical parts. To ensure that the system is able to classify images accurately, while leveraging synthetic input images, we introduce the following Functional Requirements.

\begin{itemize}
  \item [FR1] \textbf{Generate Synthetic Images}: Given a 3D model of a small mechanical part, the system should generate a set of synthetic images of said model. The system should apply a set of random transformations to the 3D model before rendering the 2D synthetic image to ensure that the generated dataset captures the SMP from as many angles in as many positions as possible.

  \item [FR2] \textbf{Add New Class to Image Classifier}: The system should accomodate the addition of a new SMP to the classifier. This extends to the ability of the system to accomodate for new input training data, and the ability to label a new output class.

  \item [FR3] \textbf{Adjust input data split}: The system should allow for changes in the training, validation and testing input data which is assigned as input to the image classifier. This includes changing the number of images in each set and manipulating the ratio of synthetic to real images in the training split.

  \item [FR4] \textbf{Retrain Image Classifier}: The system should be dynamic enough to retrain the image classifier. This step is usually taken after the augmenting or adjustment of the input data split.

  \item [FR5] \textbf{Fine-Tune Image Classifier}: The underlying CNN algorithm should be subject to fine-tuning in order to maximize the accuracy of the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

Nonfunctional Requirements (NFRs) are key system requirements that apply to the system as a whole. To maintain the system's general requirements we define the following nonfunctional requirements.

\begin{itemize}
  \item [NFR1] \textbf{Performance}: A performence requirement is the measure of a quantifiable attribute of our system. In our case we would like to track our system's \textbf{classification accuracy}.\\
  We first specify our system's accuracy for a single class to be the percentage of the given class's testing image split that the image classifier correctly predicts. We consequently define our system's classification accuracy to be the image classifier's average prediction accuracy over each class.

  \item [NFR2] \textbf{Adaptability}: Adaptability is the ability to change the system to deal with additional application domain concepts \cite{bruegge2004object}. Our system needs to be dynamic enough to accomodate for new small mechanical parts that can be later added even after the system has been deployed.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Models}

\subsection{Use Case Model}

Use case models represent the relationship between the user group of a system and the general functions that they can execute. A use case model can reduce the complexity of a system and increase its understandability.

The use case model of our system can be found as figure [\ref{fig:UCM}]. The two main protagonists of our system are the data collector, who is tasked with collecting synthetic and real images, and the machine learning expert, who is responsible for training the system to classify a set of small mechanical parts.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UCM}
\caption{Use Case Model}
\label{fig:UCM}
\end{figure}

The use case model can be divided into 3 main functions; namely generating synthetic images, obtaining real images, and training an image classifier.

\subsubsection{Generating Synthetic Images}

Generating synthetic images the cornerstone for a synthetically augmented dataset. There's a lot of work that goes into generating the 3D synthetic scene and the corresponding renditions. To increase the understandability of our model, we have separated the the use case that revolve around modeling the SMP 3D model itself as \textit{Specify3DModelTransformations}, and the use case that deals with the synthetic scene environment as \textit{SetUpSyntheticScene}.

\begin{usecase}
  \addtitle{Use Case}{Specify3DModelTransformations}

  \addfield{Participating Actors}{DataCollector}

  \addscenario{Flow of Events}{
    \item In the modeling software, the DataCollector chooses the transformations that are applicable to the small mechanical part's 3D model.
    \item For each transformation, the DataCollector sets the range of each tranformation attribute that will be later used to generate a random position for the synthetic image of the SMP.
  }

  \addfield{Entry Condition}{DataCollector has modeling software open.}

  \addfield{Exit Condition}{All the desired transformations and their corresponding attributes have been specified.}

  \additemizedfield{Quality Requirements}{
    \item In the effort to achieve the Performance Non-Functional requirement, synthetic images have to look as photo realistic as possible. The 3D transformations should strive to output the range of positions that the respective SMP can be placed in.
  }
\end{usecase}

\clearpage
\begin{usecase}
  \addtitle{Use Case}{SetUpSyntheticScene}

  \addfield{Participating Actors}{DataCollector}

  \addscenario{Flow of Events}{
    \item In the modeling software, the DataCollector places the 3D model of the SMP on a horizontal plane as if lying on a table.
    \item The DataCollector sets the background of the horizontal plane to mimic the background of the real images in the dataset.
    \item The DataCollector sets the lighting condition of the scene to reflect the lighting condition of the environment where the real SMP images are taken.
  }

  \addfield{Entry Condition}{DataCollector has modeling software open.}

  \addfield{Exit Condition}{In the modeling software, the 3D model of the SMP should be lying on a horizontal plane with a background and lighting condition that reflect the environment of the real SMP images.}

  \additemizedfield{Quality Requirements}{
    \item The synthetic scene should look as photorealistic as possible. This helps the Image Classifier achieve a higher classification accuracy using the synthetic images.
  }
\end{usecase}

\clearpage
\begin{usecase}
  \addtitle{Use Case}{GenerateSyntheticImages}

  \addfield{Participating Actors}{DataCollector}

  \addscenario{Flow of Events}{
    \item The DataCollector specifies the desired number of output synthetic images.
    \item The modeling software generates the desired number of output synthetic images. Each image is a rendition of the scene after the transformations have been applied to the 3D model.
  }

  \addfield{Entry Condition}{DataCollector has modeling software open.}

  \addfield{Exit Condition}{The DataCollector obtains a set of synthetic images for the specified SMP that can be later used to train the Image Classifier.}
\end{usecase}

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Obtaining Real Images}

\begin{usecase}
  \addtitle{Use Case}{TakeRealImages}

  \addfield{Participating Actors}{DataCollector}

  \addscenario{Flow of Events}{
    \item The DataCollector places the camera over a plane.
    \item The DataCollector sets the SMP over the plane in a random position, such that the full SMP body is within the viewfield of the camera.
    \item The DataCollector takes a picture of the SMP.
    \item The DataCollector repeats steps 2 and 3 until the desired number of real images of the SMP is reached.
    \item The DataCollector resizes the images to correspond to the input image size of the Image Classifier. 
  }

  \addfield{Entry Condition}{}

  \addfield{Exit Condition}{The DataCollector obtains a set of real images for the specified SMP that can be later used to train the Image Classifier.}

  \additemizedfield{Quality Requirements}{
    \item The lighting of the environment should eliminate shadows and light reflections on the SMP surface.
  }
\end{usecase}

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Training the Image Classifier}

Training the image classifier requires some underlying work. We have chosen to model this use case as one that includes setting up the input data and configuring the image classifier (modeled as \textit{SetInputDataSplit} and \textit{SetUpImageClassifier} respectively).

\begin{usecase}
  \addtitle{Use Case}{TrainImageClassifier}

  \addfield{Participating Actors}{MachineLearningEngineer}

  \addscenario{Flow of Events}{
    \item The MachineLearningEngineer configures the dataset structure: number of images for training, validation and testing, as well as the ratio of real to synthetic images in the training split.
    \item The MachineLearningEngineer chooses a convolutional neural network architecture for the Image Classifier.
    \item The MachineLearningEngineer fine-tunes the CNN by manipulating its hyperparameters.
  }

  \addfield{Entry Condition}{For each SMP set to be classified by the Image Classifier, the corresponding real and synthetic images should be generated and ready for use.}

  \addfield{Exit Condition}{The Image Classifier outputs the maximum possible accuracy given the input dataset.}
\end{usecase}

\subsection{Analysis Object Model}

The analysis object model is a visual dictionary of the main concepts visible to the user \cite{bruegge2004object}. The analysis object model depicts a system's entites, their corresponding attributes and functions, and illustrates the relationship between said entitie. Figure [\ref{fig:AOM}] represents the analysis object model of our system.

\subsubsection{SmallMechanicalPart}
A small mechanical part is the main subject of our system. It is an object that our system aims to classify. Each SMP has a unique identifying label string.

\subsubsection{3DModel}
A 3DModel of a small mechanical part is the graphical model which helps our system create synthetic images. Each SMP has a corresponding 3DModel. Each 3DModel has the same label as its SMP counterpart.

\subsubsection{Transformation}
Each SMP and 3DModel have a list of applicable transformations. A transformation is executed on an axis (x, y or z), and can either be a Translation or a Rotation.
At image generation time, each transformation outputs a random value between its defined maximum and minimum. We define a range to limit an object's transformation. For instance, we don't want to translate an SMP so far as to remove it from the camera's viewfield.

\subsubsection{ImageGenerator}
ImageGenerator is the class that does the heavy lifting when it comes to creating images. It applies the random transformations on the target object and generates an image with a specified width and height.
ImageGenerator is an abstraction of 2 classes. SyntheticImageGenerator is responsible for applying the transformations on 3DModels, and using SyntheticScene to generate SyntheticImages, while RealImageGenerator uses a camera to take pictures of SmallMechanicalParts and output their corresponding RealImages.

\subsubsection{Image}
Image is a generalization of RealImage and SyntheticImage. Image stores information like width, height and label of the image. Moreover it contains a dataBuffer which contains the actual image pixel values.

\subsubsection{Dataset}
Dataset is a composition of Images. It is the image repository which is used by the ImageClassifier for training and evaluation.

\subsubsection{DataSplitGenerator}
DataSplitGenerator splits the Dataset into a training set, validation set and testing set. This split prepares the data for consumption by the ImageClassifier.

\subsubsection{CNNModel}
CNNModel is the convolutional neural network algorithm that is trained for image classification. CNNModel is an abstraction of 4 different CNN architectures, namely Inception, Resnet, VGG16 and VGG19. Furthermore, CNNModel defines the weights that are used to initialize the CNN to leverage the power of transfer learning. CNNModel also sets the number of trainable layers in a network to potentially preserve the initial weights and speed up training.

\subsubsection{Optimizer}
Each CNNModel has an Optimizer. An Optimizer is the function aims to close the gap between the model's predictions of the validation set labels and their corresponding ground truth. The Optimizer operates in the CNNModel's training phase. Optimizer is an abstraction of 2 different optimizers that we use in our system. Specifically SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), and Adam.

\subsubsection{ImageClassifier}
ImageClassifier orchestrates the feeding of data into the CNNModel for training. Moreover, it uses the testing set to calculate the accuracy of the trained model.

\subsection{Dynamic Model}

The dynamic model is focused on the behavior of the system. Sequence diagrams, activity diagrams and state machines are usually used to depict dynamic models \cite{bruegge2004object}. In this section we present 2 activity diagrams that depict the 2 main workflows of our system.

\subsubsection{Dataset Generation}

Figure [\ref{fig:AD1}] depicts the workflow of activities required to generate a dataset. The DataCollector selects a small mechanical part and its corresponding 3D model. The DataCollector then proceeds to generate the real and synthetic images. Finally the images are combined to form a dataset.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{AD1}
\caption{Activity Diagram depicting the workflow required for Dataset generation}
\label{fig:AD1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Training the Image Classifier}

Figure [\ref{fig:AD2}] describes the workflow of activities required to train the image classifier. The MachineLearningEngineer splits the data into training, validation and testing sets. The MachineLearningEngineer then creates a CNN model. Next the MachineLearningEngineer feeds the training data to the CNN model to obtained a trained CNN model. The MachineLearningEngineer then evaluates the trained CNN model accuracy using the testing set. If the accuracy of the trained CNN model is not sufficient, the CNN model is fine tuned and re-trained.
